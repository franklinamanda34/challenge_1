Create a well functioning easy accesible site for a marketing agency

What was acheived:
-Rebuild HTML with semantic elements
-Allow the headings to be displayed in order
-Add a title element so that the user can navigate which tab has this application open

Please use the following link to view the deployed application:

The structure of this project really focuses on semantic elements

HTML and CSS were used to build this application.

Challenges:
Getting the aside element to function properly within the CSS

For Future improvements I would like to revisit and follow more of a sequence as stated in the user story.
